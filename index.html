		<h4>TicTacPro</h4>
        <h5><a href="https://mckyle099.github.io/TicTacPro">TicTacPro</a></h5>
        <p>
		    The first project I built in Unity. Uses a C# Lua interpreter called MoonSharp to allow
		    the players to write their own TicTacToe AI. Added an additional game mode called TicTacPro
			that changes the traditionally synchronous TicTacToe game to asynchronous.

        <br/>
		
		<h4>Code->RTS()</h4>
        <h5><a href="https://code-rts.com">Code->RTS()</a></h5>
        <p>
		    A more ambitious Unity project. Similar to TicTacPro, the idea is for the player to write
			their own AI to play an RTS game. Players must continuously improve their AI to beat
			levels that increase in difficulty as they progress. Players can compete their AIs against
			each other to see who has the better AI. Used IronPython for the C# embedded Python 
			interpreter. Used Sphinx to generate the API reference website.

            Diablo II is one of my favourite games of all time. However, after 20 years the game
            started to get stale and I started playing mods that added new content such as items,
            item stats, recipes, etc. Many of the mods suffered from the same problem, there was no
            good way to get visibility in to what the mod added or changed. Some mods had database
            websites that were maintained by hand, often riddled with outdated, incorrect and
            missing information. The amount of time and effort to maintain these databases was
            enormous, and were usually only maintained by the same people developing the mod
            (which was more often than not a single person). To solve this problem, I wrote a set
            of python scripts that read the Diablo II game files and output an html database of
            all the items, item stats, recipes, etc in a generic way that any Diablo II mod can
            utilize.
