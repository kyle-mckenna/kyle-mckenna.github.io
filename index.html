            Diablo II is one of my favourite games of all time. However, after 20 years the game
            started to get stale and I started playing mods that added new content such as items,
            item stats, recipes, etc. Many of the mods suffered from the same problem, there was no
            good way to get visibility in to what the mod added or changed. Some mods had database
            websites that were maintained by hand, often riddled with outdated, incorrect and
            missing information. The amount of time and effort to maintain these databases was
            enormous, and were usually only maintained by the same people developing the mod
            (which was more often than not a single person). To solve this problem, I wrote a set
            of python scripts that read the Diablo II game files and output an html database of
            all the items, item stats, recipes, etc in a generic way that any Diablo II mod can
            utilize.
